### ex3_topten.py

This script reads a folder of files and count top ten countries with most often occurrences in the files.

### ex5_meanSalary.R

Main goal of the task is to try Spark SQL in action.

In this file there is a R program that reads JSON with vacancies and calculates mean salaries for programmers, designers, and system administrators with per city breakdown.

I chose SparkR as implementation language because the task reads as a perfect match of what the language is designed for. However I found that SparkR is incomplete and inefficient for complex tasks and hence choosing it was a bad idea.
